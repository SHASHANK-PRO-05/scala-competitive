### Synopsis

This is my research on competitive programming. It's been a while now that I have been participating in competitive programming, and now, I want to delve deeper into the concepts.
This Field is fascinating and want to explore this field considering scala as my primary language. I will be using Hackerearth for my voyage.

### How this works?

For each question that I will solve, I will write the test cases as well as documentation on how I solved it, plus, what all things I found extra on the net. In src folder every question will have a separate package.
