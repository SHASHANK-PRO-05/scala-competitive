###Magic Box
So, Magic Box is a very interesting problem to solve and to be honest, you need some mathematics backgroud.
I do not have that so I had to read online tutorials to solve this problem. Well, it was worth reading

If n is odd the problem is very simple. Let me show you the pattern
<pre>
0 0 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 1 6 | 8 1 6 | 8 1 6
0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 3 0 0 | 3 0 0 | 3 5 0 | 3 5 7 | 3 5 7 | 3 5 7
0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 2 | 0 0 2 | 4 0 2 | 4 0 2 | 4 0 2 | 4 0 2 | 4 9 2
</pre>
Find the pattern how I am adding the new number.
