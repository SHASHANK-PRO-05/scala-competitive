So in this problem, we have to find the intersection point of two linked list.
1) It is guaranteed that there is an intersection
2) We cannot use any other data structure.
3) Only thing given to us is two linked list

While finding the solution, I came across an algorithm which is Floyd Cycle Detection. That is also there in the system

While making this solution make sure you traverse the the second list n+1 time where n being size of first list.
Only then you reach the floyd cycle solution else say goodbye.
